# SkinFormer: Statistical Texture Transformer for Skin Lesion Segmentation

Implementation of "SkinFormer: Statistical Texture Transformer for Skin Lesion Segmentation" (Under Review).

For the Kurtosis-guided Statistical Counting Operator (KSCO), see the Models/networks/sat_tex.py.

For the Statistical Texture Fusion Transformer (STFT) and the Statistical Texture Enhance Transformer (STET), see the Models/networks/net.py

We will refine the code after the paper is accepted.
